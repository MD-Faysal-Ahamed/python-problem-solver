# Python-Based Problem Solving Application

This is a simple Python application that solves math/logic problems entered by the user.  
It uses the `sympy` library to process and solve expressions.

# Description: A simple problem solver that takes user input,
# validates it, processes the input, and returns a solution.

        return True
    except:
